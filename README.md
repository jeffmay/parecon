ParEcon stands for "Participatory Economics," a proposal for a more efficient, transparent, and democratic
control of the prices of goods based on resource usage, workplace inefficiencies, and cultural preferences
as well as consumer inefficiencies.

The idea is that the prices of goods and services would be driven by a market, but not the "free" market we
currently have. It would be one in which your freedom stems from your actual specific needs.

It works like so:

1. Producers estimate how much they can profit at a given certain price of their goods (most already do this)

2. Producers provide a bid for how much they think they can produce, this determines "planned supply"

3. Consumers provide a list of the quantities they want, the determines "planned demand".

4. Producers and consumers have respective councils that start from the bottom and work their way up.
   Workers operate within teams inside a firm to help produce the firm's estimated output, which then
   works its way to the economic vertical with all other companies, then to industry. Consumers submit
   their plans to neighborhood councils where they can vote / pay for new things like a playground or
   a swimming pool, and where requests for a massive shipment of drugs would be approved / vetoed.
   These requests are then deidentified, aggregated, and passed up to the city / district for approval,
   then the state, then federal level. At each point the state or city can intervene to veto certain
   long-term purchase decisions like stadiums, etc.

5. This planned supply and demand data is then contrasted. If they are two far apart, then the IRB
   (explained below) can request a rebid based on a new price. This rebid manifests as a request for
   confirmation on items purchased at a new price. Consumers can set their boundaries for these trades
   however they want. Producers have to decide whether this new price will affect their output.
   Ultimately the planned price of the goods are set each week and companies have to meet their estimates
   to get their full payment.

6. If producers fail to estimate properly, then the producers doesn't make enough money by either
   producing too little for the price or producing more than they get paid for. They may have to
   update their "unplanned prices" to cover the difference of the rebid. If they choose to abstain,
   since the price would be lower than the cost, then they are effectively out of business. There are
   ways to mitigate cascading failures through financial reallocation (being bought out).

7. Consumers see this rebid of price reflected with a denial of purchase for the items that have increased
   in price or an increase in their unplanned budget if the items become cheaper. Handling the denial
   of planned purchases of the consumer can be predetermined to always pull from their unplanned budget
   so that the user can pick which items they absolutely need, regardless of price. But their unplanned
   budget cannot be zero. It has a fixed window of proportion set by the IRB.

8. I should be able to purchase my shirt from Amazon without waiting for the IRB to resolve some conflict.
   Fortunately, you can make unplanned purchases with a higher sales tax (but possibly a even lower price!)
   The IRB will eat the cost if the planned estimates are too high.

5. Unplanned sales are not paid directly, they are paid by a consumer council to the IRB, which then
   uses that money to pay the producers using the planned price for the items as a gauge. If the planned
   price was too high and producers could make money by selling goods cheaper than the planned price,
   then they contribute to a post-sale adjustment (more on this later), in which the price paid back to
   producers is adjusted based on unplanned sales. If unplanned sales are high, then

6. The IRB's revenue comes from a tax on the transaction that is divided between the producer and consumer.
   The extent to which IRB is inaccurate in its price / plan versus actual output is the extent to which
   the tax is returned to either the producers or consumer for mis-allocation. If the IRB is accurate,
   then it keeps all of the tax collected. This is its incentive to be accurate and unbiased.

7. Producer's can request new bids on price if the unplanned demand is increasing. This will insure a better
   price, as paid by the consumer councils from the collective pool of unplanned spending (of which the
   consumers are forced to stick within or work with to trade).

8. It would be equally ideal if this system was able to resolve these mismatching values in real time to
   quickly address the mismatch and update their prices automatically.

9. It would be even more equally ideal if this system allowed companies to overproduce to lower their price
   so that other companies, factories, and farms can raise their price to survive. Overproduction would
   not be rewarded other than by fame and distribution, which would give you data you could use to raise
   prices on more popular items to reduce the amount of work that people are doing.

10.But it must also equally and fairly be able to determine who cannot afford to make shirts at the price,
   and cut them out from the deal. Their prices will change, and if that change is not communicated back
   into the system, the IRB gets called in again.

In order to do #5 adequately, you need software to help. Information about how much producers can make has
to be captured in real-time.

Now, we couldn't assume that "real-time" will be anything other than pre-approved manager signed, sealed,
and delivered with perfect ego in tact.

The best approach to solving this kind of problem is a protocol. Each industry can use or buy the software
they need to interact with the system. The government will provide one for the common people, and to
cut down on the inefficiency of having everyone calculating prices in separate systems with little feedback
into the actual calculations of price.


Producers
=========

It all starts with production. Laborers provide estimates to their bosses (as is common the case in our
corporate-firm-based economy) on how many items can get produced by when. If.


Consumers
=========

In principle, the algorithm goes like this:

1. You pick the things you want to buy for next week based on price and description.

2. Any purchases you have to make during the week that are not on your plan list are charged at an
   unplanned rate.

3. The suppliers have already estim

4. That price is then updated based on the plans and fed back to the manufacturers of goods
   in terms of demand data.


The Iteration Review Board (IRB)
================================

If the demand is too high for the manufacturers to produce the next shipment, then this has to be
communicated back into the system. The IRB is there to help audit that process. Most of this
interaction should be simple, and not gamified to the Nth degree. It is really just an estimate of
how much you can produce, relative to others. If the industry can't meet the demand of the consumers
(of which the industry members also are), then the price of those goods go up.

If the demand is low and the suppliers can make more than is needed, then the price drops so that
businesses have a chance to shift production. The company, factory, or farm has a window of time to
announce how many units it can produce. The sooner the announcement, the better, so the IRB can
provide a common interface to feed the real-time information from the consumer broker back to the
producer broker.

The consumers are represented by their individual and cumulative plans, which happens every so
often for macro-level purchases. You would place an order for what items you want for the next week.
These items would then be used to make a macro-level demand estimate that companies can plan for.

Your plan would also include discretionary spending you could use to buy items outside of this plan.
This comes with fees or possibly based on credit as companies do not get paid for producing more than
their macro level estimate. They can choose to distribute or not on their own. Most corporations
use lending schemes for expensive items. This would raise the scope to include transactions as simple
as bubblegum, however. This demands a good technical solution.

The credit side of the economy is an interesting problem, but I imagine it will be a lot like credit
cards that keep track of who you owe. You would have 2 cards: a credit card for unplanned purchases
and a card for planned purchases. Planned purchases would have to be entered into the system
electronically as well. This would add the bi-directional data-flow required to make this real-time
adjusting of price work.

Responsibilities:

1. The IRB would be responsible for deciding when a company must submit their macro-level estimates
   or be excluded from the price adjustment.

2. To help small businesses and individuals to integrate their production estimates into the larger industry.

3. To coordinate and confirm the transactions between companies that coordinate s strategy to handle
   either an influx in demand or lack of supply.

4. To aggregate the demand and supply information to make a decision on the price paid out for goods.

5. To provide a real-time feed of the aggregate current supply, demand, and price information.

6. To provide console for integrating with this real-time feed, so that smaller companies can
   adjust their prices quick enough so as not to overprice or under-price their goods. Companies
   can under-price or over-price their unplanned purchase price, but not the planned price.

7. To report the difference between the company's unplanned price and the planned price, so that
   consumers can know how much they are losing when purchasing the item in an unplanned session.
